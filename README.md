# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis 📊

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from transactional data that can help businesses understand customer patterns, improve decision-making, and optimize marketing strategies.

The project covers the complete data analytics lifecycle — from raw data processing to visualization and reporting.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains customer-level shopping information such as:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Product category
  - Purchase amount
  - Discounts and subscriptions
  - Purchase frequency
  - Review ratings
- Data was initially stored in CSV format and later loaded into relational databases for analysis.

> Note: The dataset is used strictly for learning and analytical purposes.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Data cleaning, EDA, and analysis
- **SQL** – PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server for querying data
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics
- **Gamma** – Presentation (PPT) creation
- **GitHub** – Version control and project sharing

## Project Workflow / Steps

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded dataset into Python using Pandas
   - Imported data into SQL databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL)

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized column names
   - Corrected data types
   - Removed inconsistencies

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed customer demographics
   - Identified spending patterns
   - Studied discount and subscription impact
   - Performed category and age-based analysis

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Wrote complex SQL queries using:
     - Joins
     - Subqueries
     - CTEs
     - Window functions
   - Segmented customers and calculated revenue metrics

5. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
   - Visualized KPIs such as:
     - Revenue by age group
     - Category-wise sales
     - Subscription impact
     - Customer segmentation

6. **Reporting & Presentation**
   - Created a detailed analytical report
   - Designed a professional presentation (PPT) using Gamma

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Interactive filters (Age Group, Category, Subscription)
- Revenue and customer insights
- Visual comparison across demographics
- Clear KPIs for business understanding

---

## Key Results & Insights
- Certain age groups contribute significantly higher revenue
- Subscribed customers tend to be repeat buyers
- Discount strategies influence purchasing behavior
- A small set of products dominates category-level sales
- Customer segmentation helps identify loyal and high-value customers
